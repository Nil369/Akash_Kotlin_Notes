# Introduction to Kotlin

## What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a modern programming language developed by JetBrains that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's designed to be concise, safe, and interoperable with existing Java code.

### Key Features:
- 100% interoperable with Java
- Null safety built into the type system
- Concise syntax
- Smart type inference
- Coroutines for asynchronous programming
- Extension functions
- Data classes
- First-class delegation

## Why Kotlin?

1. **Modern Language Features**
   - Null safety
   - Smart casts
   - Data classes
   - Coroutines
   - Extension functions

2. **Industry Adoption**
   - Official language for Android development
   - Used by major companies like Google, Netflix, Uber
   - Growing community and ecosystem

3. **Developer Productivity**
   - Less boilerplate code
   - Better IDE support
   - Safer code with null safety
   - More expressive syntax

## Setting up the Development Environment

### Prerequisites:
1. JDK (Java Development Kit) 8 or higher
2. IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
3. Kotlin plugin (if not using IntelliJ IDEA)

### Installation Steps:

1. **Install JDK**
   ```bash
   # For Windows (using Chocolatey)
   choco install openjdk11
   
   # For macOS (using Homebrew)
   brew install openjdk@11
   
   # For Linux
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
   ```

2. **Install IntelliJ IDEA**
   - Download from: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
   - Community Edition is free and sufficient for learning

3. **Create Your First Kotlin Project**
   ```kotlin
   // HelloWorld.kt
   fun main() {
       println("Hello, Kotlin!")
   }
   ```

### Running Your First Program:

1. Create a new Kotlin project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Create a new Kotlin file
3. Write the code above
4. Click the green run button or press Shift+F10

## Basic Project Structure

```
src/
├── main/
│   └── kotlin/
│       └── com/
│           └── example/
│               └── HelloWorld.kt
└── test/
    └── kotlin/
        └── com/
            └── example/
                └── HelloWorldTest.kt
```

## Next Steps

After setting up your environment, you can proceed to:
1. Learn about variables and data types
2. Understand control flow
3. Explore functions and lambdas
4. Dive into object-oriented programming

Remember: Kotlin is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, especially if you're coming from Java or other object-oriented languages.
